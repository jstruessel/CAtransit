Data Wrangling project
Within this github repository I transformed some data I found within California's open data portal, and created a dashboard presentation of it. Data cleaning and display gives the code used to give displays as well as remove errors and extreme outliers from the data. Once this was done i used the code within the Dash Code section to run an app to interact with the data.
